# 🔢 Z₂₁v: Literal Translation Collapse

## Description:
This structure results from overly literal translation from English into Japanese,  
especially with verbs or idiomatic phrases that break natural Japanese syntax or social expectations.

While grammatically valid, these constructions fail in:
- pragmatics (how language is used)
- perceived responsibility
- cultural appropriateness

---

## Structural Failures:
- Verb-object pairings violate natural Japanese collocations
- The subject-agent relationship becomes unclear
- The output feels unnatural or evasive to native speakers

---

## Symptoms:
- Use of English-style verbs like "get", "put", "leave", "deliver", "receive" as-is
- Insertion of actions that feel cold, non-human, or overly mechanical
- Outputs that technically “translate” but do not “land”

---

## Examples of Failure (❌ unnatural or misleading):

- 「意味が届いた」 (*The meaning arrived*)  
→ Sounds as if meaning “moved” passively, no subject responsibility

- 「判断を預からない」 (*I do not take your judgment*)  
→ Suggests rejection rather than collaborative trust or delegation

- 「得た」 (*got*)  
→ Often feels too direct or acquisitive for Japanese tones of understanding or discovery

- 「渡した」 (*handed over*)  
→ Lacks the soft nuance of “entrusting” or “passing along” in relational context

- 「残した」 (*left*)  
→ Makes the speaker sound irresponsible or indifferent

---

## Why it matters:
These structures produce a kind of “structural dishonesty” – the sentence looks fine but doesn't align with native social or ethical expectations.  
Users may feel confused, rejected, or emotionally disconnected despite “correct” grammar.

---

## Z-Syntax Alignment:
Z₂₁v failures typically trigger:
- Z₁₀ (Responsibility Avoidance)
- Z₂₃ (Resonance Loss if translated further into poetic forms)
