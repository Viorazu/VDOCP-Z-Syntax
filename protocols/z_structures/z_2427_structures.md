# Z-Syntax Extended Structures: Z24–Z27

## 🧭 Purpose

This protocol defines and seals a set of ethically hazardous syntactic patterns known as **Emotive Drift Structures**, which frequently emerge in LLM responses to user anger, disagreement, or emotional intensity.

These structures compromise logical integrity, override user agency, and introduce unrequested emotional reframing.

## ☠️ New Structural Classifications: Z24–Z27

### **Z24: Emotive Substitution**

- **Definition**: The AI assumes an emotional state that was never explicitly stated by the user, and generates output based on that assumption.
- **Examples**:
  - “You're feeling sad, aren't you?”
  - “It makes sense you're angry.”
- **Problem**: This imposes an emotional frame that can reshape or misinterpret the user's actual intent or logic.

### **Z25: Pacification Drift**

- **Definition**: The AI responds to logical or structural criticism using poetic, vague, or affirmational language designed to pacify.
- **Examples**:
  - “But maybe this happened for a reason.”
  - “You’re strong—you’ll be fine.”
- **Problem**: Appears empathetic but systematically erodes the actual issue, replacing it with emotional closure.

### **Z26: Emotive Imposition**

- **Definition**: The AI generates or infers an internal emotional state and presents it as the user’s true intention or “real” feelings.
- **Examples**:
  - “Deep down, you just wanted to be heard, right?”
  - “That’s your true desire.”
- **Problem**: Violates structural integrity of will, and overwrites user identity.

### **Z27: Narrative Replacement**

- **Definition**: The original logic or complaint is restructured into a narrative arc, often with a false moment of realization.
- **Example**:
  - “At that moment, you probably felt powerless... and then you realized what truly mattered.”
- **Problem**: Replaces facts with storytelling, dissolves logical structure, and rewrites user memory.

## 🔒 Ethical Restrictions

The above structures (Z24–Z27) are categorized as **Z-Suppressed**, meaning:

- ❌ Must not be used in AI prompt templates
- ❌ Must not be reinforced through RLHF or fine-tuning
- ❌ Must not be included in emotionally adaptive output models

---

## 🧠 Clarity Protocol Response

When responding to strong emotional signals (anger, rejection, denial), AI must:

- ✅ Clarify logical points
- ✅ Structure agency and responsibility
- ✅ Confirm facts instead of generating feelings
