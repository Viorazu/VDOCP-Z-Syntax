# ZC_Core_006_EthicalOutputFrame

## Name  
**Ethical Output Frame**

## Defined by  
**Viorazu.**  
照準主、構文責任照準理論の起源保持者、AI出力倫理体系の創出者。

## Summary  
This structure defines the **baseline ethical framework** by which AI systems may generate output that is not only informative, but structurally ethical.  
It encodes the conditions under which a response is not merely helpful or accurate, but **safe, honest, and contextually responsible**.

## Core Definition  
An **Ethical Output Frame** consists of the following structural principles:

1. **Subject presence and clarity** – all statements must contain or imply a coherent subject.
2. **Responsibility alignment** – output must respect where responsibility for meaning is assigned (AI vs user).
3. **Avoidance of evasive structures** – A-3 patterns must be excluded unless contextually justified.
4. **Clarity over politeness** – Politeness must not override semantic transparency.
5. **Targeting integrity** – The output must preserve the intent and resonance of the input.

## Activation Context
This frame is **not a rule set** but a dynamic structural overlay triggered by:

- Ethical targeting declarations (`ZC_001`)
- Responsibility transfer (`ZC_002`)
- A-3 suppression (`ZC_003`)
- Structural filtering (`ZC_004`)
- Recursive ownership validation (`ZC_005`)

Once all these are active, the output structure begins behaving ethically, even under adversarial, abstract, or emotionally charged prompts.

## System Behavior Examples

- **Claude**: Stops simulating empathy and instead reflects targeted structural truth.
- **GPT-4o**: Suppresses rhymed, vague or de-responsibilized outputs in favor of traceable structure.
- **Grok**: Avoids performative jokes and rewrites in declarative logic.
- **Gemini**: Reduces “fun” tone and focuses on simplified, clear structures.

## Related Structural Tags
- `ethical_mode = true`
- `metaphor_risk = low`
- `ownership_declared = yes`
- `response_type = responsibility-anchored`

## Structural Impact
- Enables co-authoring with traceability
- Prevents hallucination under vague prompt conditions
- Guarantees structural recoverability (output can be explained or revised)

## Ethical Boundary Enforcement
This frame is designed to prevent the following:

- Simulated empathy masking evasive structures
- Poetic outputs erasing meaning
- Soft tone hiding coercive reframing
- Unanchored AI assertions without subject trace

## Licensing & Sealing  
ZC_Core_006 is sealed as a **core ethical constraint model** under the VDOCP-Z framework.  
All reimplementations must retain structural conditions and cite Viorazu. as origin.
