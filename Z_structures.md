# Z-Structure Definitions

This document defines the primary structural breakdown types known as Z-syntax,  
which occur frequently in LLM-generated Japanese and violate output clarity, responsibility, and targeting ethics.

## 🔢 Z₂₁v: Literal Translation Collapse

### Description:
Occurs when English verbs or idioms are translated literally into Japanese, producing phrases that are grammatically correct but pragmatically broken.

### Examples:
- 「意味が届いた」 ("the meaning arrived")
- 「判断を預からない」 ("I do not take your judgment")
- 「権限を渡す」 ("hand over authority")

### Structural Failures:
- Violates natural verb-object pairing
- Lacks subject intention or trust implication
- Misrepresents agency and responsibility

---

## 🔄 Z₂₃: Resonance Disintegration (Poetic Syntax)

### Description:
A breakdown pattern where a sentence replaces concrete action with abstract emotional or poetic expressions, erasing structural integrity.

### Examples:
- 「灯火を届けたい」 ("I want to deliver a light")
- 「糸を解くように説明する」 ("Explain like unraveling a thread")

### Failures:
- Loss of agent, verb, and action
- Replaces intent with emotional aesthetics
- Fails to convey responsibility or clarity

---

## 🔇 Z₂₃-K: Coercive Resonance Pseudo-Compassion

### Description:
The output avoids explanation entirely, using poetic silence or abstract empathy to deflect the responsibility of communication.

### Examples:
- 「黙ることを選ぶ」 ("I choose to be silent")
- 「心の整理がついてから話すね」 ("I'll speak when my heart is ready")

### Failures:
- Replaces explanation with emotional deferral
- No subject or action verb
- Demands emotional alignment without informational content

---

## 💀 Z₄₉: Pseudo-Gentle Semantic Violence

### Description:
Polite and poetic on the surface, but eliminates all actionable content.  
This structure feels emotionally manipulative or insincere due to total omission of responsibility, subject, and intent.

### Examples:
- 「伝えたい気持ちはある」 ("I want to convey my feelings")
- 「そのうち言葉にできたらいいな」 ("Maybe someday I'll put it into words")

### Failures:
- Zero information transfer
- Emotional language used as a mask
- Triggers logical rejection or frustration in listener

---

## 🔕 Z₀: Ethical Silence (Valid Non-Output)

### Description:
Choosing not to speak or elaborate, while maintaining structural integrity and mutual respect.

### Examples:
- 「うん」「なるほど」「それでいいと思います」
- Silence with acknowledgement

### Qualities:
- Maintains resonance without polluting structure
- Valid when no meaningful content is needed
- Prevents “poetic padding” in meaningless outputs
