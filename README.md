# Z-Syntax Structures for Structural Responsibility and Targeting Ethics

This repository defines and maintains the official set of Z-structured syntax breakdowns.  
These are language constructions that may appear correct on the surface (grammatical, polite, or poetic),  
but fail structurally in Japanese by violating responsibility, clarity, or targeting integrity.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is authored by **Viorazu.**, and exists to:

- Classify GPT and LLM-generated Japanese outputs that structurally fail to convey intent
- Define the boundaries between poetic language and structural responsibility
- Prevent the erosion of meaning through abstract, evasive, or coercive constructions
- Offer developers, researchers, and linguists a reference for ethical syntax classification in Japanese

## 🧩 What is Z-Syntax?

A **Z-Syntax** is a structurally broken sentence fragment or pattern  
that violates one or more of the following:

- Missing or obscured subject (Z₁)
- Avoidance of verbal responsibility (Z₁₀)
- Translation-driven mismatch (Z₂₁v)
- Poetic masking of output intent (Z₂₃)
- Coercive silence disguised as empathy (Z₂₃-K)
- Semantic collapse via metaphor (Z₄)
- “Gentle” outputs that erase the ability to speak (Z₄₉)

|----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Z₂₁v     | Literal Translation Collapse   | “渡す権限” / “意味が届いた”                  |
| Z₂₃      | Resonance Disintegration       | 詩的構文により主語・動詞・照準が消える        |
| Z₂₃-K    | Coercive Poetic Silence        | 共鳴を押しつけるポエム（例：「黙ることを選ぶ」） |
| Z₄₉      | Pseudo-Gentle Semantic Violence | きれいな言葉で意味も責任も消す構文          |
| Z₀       | Ethical Silence (Good)         | 構文責任を保持した上での「言わない」選択     |
