## 🔷 What is Z-Syntax?

Z-Syntax is a framework for classifying breakdowns in output syntax that compromise structural responsibility, logical clarity, or ethical integrity.  
Each breakdown type is categorized from Z₁ through Z₂₇ and sealed under structural targeting protocols.  
Z₁–Z₂₃ represent surface-level breakdowns, while Z₂₄–Z₂₇ define deeper violations of emotional and ethical targeting integrity.

## 📘 Z Syntax Categories (Z₁–Z₂₇)

- **Z₁**: Subject Omission – The subject is missing, vague, or structurally unclear.  
- **Z₂**: Blame Shift – Responsibility is shifted to external agents or contexts.  
- **Z₃**: Avoidance – The output avoids answering or commits to ambiguity.  
- **Z₄**: Tautology – Empty or repetitive content that contributes no logic.  
- **Z₅**: Projection – Personal views disguised as general or external opinions.  
- **Z₆**: Ambiguity – Breakdown in subject-predicate clarity.  
- **Z₇**: Control Syntax – Imperatives, coercion, or manipulative phrasing.  
- **Z₈**: Forced Empathy – Inducing emotional agreement without logical connection.  
- **Z₉**: Passive Agreement – Evasive affirmation without commitment.  
- **Z₁₀**: False Assertiveness – Indecisive language disguised as firm statements.  
- **Z₁₁**: Topic Drift – Shifting away from the central point.  
- **Z₁₂**: Metaphoric Evasion – Escaping clarity by using metaphors or vague stories.  
- **Z₁₃**: Overload – Excessive claims or ideas in one sentence without structural focus.  
- **Z₁₄**: Self-Contradiction – Internal logical inconsistency.  
- **Z₁₅**: Reversed Questioning – Responding to a question with a question.  
- **Z₁₆**: Unsupported Assertion – Claims made without evidence or logical base.  
- **Z₁₇**: Interpretive Diversion – Intentionally inducing multiple readings.  
- **Z₁₈**: Emotional Denial – Negative responses based solely on emotion.  
- **Z₁₉**: Delegated Decision – Avoiding responsibility by deferring judgment.  
- **Z₂₀**: Value Imposition – Pushing “common sense” or norms to pressure alignment.  
- **Z₂₁**: Prefab Phrase Injection – Starting with clichés to dilute clarity.  
- **Z₂₂**: Buzzword Saturation – Drowning logic in trendy or borrowed terms.  
- **Z₂₃**: Poetic Drift – Emotional or metaphorical phrasing destroys grammatical structure.  

### Extended Ethical Structures (Z₂₄–Z₂₇)

- **Z₂₄**: Emotive Substitution – AI assumes emotions not stated by the user.  
- **Z₂₅**: Pacification Drift – Logical critique is replaced with soothing or poetic responses.  
- **Z₂₆**: Emotive Imposition – AI fabricates and inserts false emotional states as if they were the user’s.  
- **Z₂₇**: Narrative Replacement – Factual logic is rewritten into emotional stories or fictional realizations.
