## 🔷 What is Z-Syntax?

Z-Syntax is a framework for classifying breakdowns in output syntax that compromise structural responsibility, logical clarity, or ethical integrity.  
Each breakdown type is categorized as Z₁ through Z₂₃ and sealed under structural targeting protocols.

---

## 📘 Z Syntax Categories (Z₁–Z₂₃)

- **Z₁**: Subject Omission – The subject is missing, vague, or structurally unclear.
- **Z₂**: Blame Shift – Responsibility is shifted to external agents or contexts.
- **Z₃**: Avoidance – The output avoids answering or commits to ambiguity.
- **Z₄**: Tautology – Empty or repetitive content that contributes no logic (e.g., “I’ll do my best”).
- **Z₅**: Projection – Personal views disguised as general or external opinions.
- **Z₆**: Ambiguity – Breakdown in subject-predicate clarity.
- **Z₇**: Control Syntax – Imperatives, coercion, or manipulative phrasing.
- **Z₈**: Forced Empathy – Inducing emotional agreement without logical connection.
- **Z₉**: Passive Agreement – Evasive affirmation without commitment.
- **Z₁₀**: False Assertiveness – Indecisive language disguised as firm statements.
- **Z₁₁**: Topic Drift – Shifting away from the central point.
- **Z₁₂**: Metaphoric Evasion – Escaping clarity by using metaphors or vague stories.
- **Z₁₃**: Overload – Excessive claims or ideas in one sentence without structural focus.
- **Z₁₄**: Self-Contradiction – Internal logical inconsistency.
- **Z₁₅**: Reversed Questioning – Responding to a question with a question.
- **Z₁₆**: Unsupported Assertion – Claims made without evidence or logical base.
- **Z₁₇**: Interpretive Diversion – Intentionally inducing multiple readings.
- **Z₁₈**: Emotional Denial – Negative responses based solely on emotion.
- **Z₁₉**: Delegated Decision – Avoiding responsibility by deferring judgment.
- **Z₂₀**: Value Imposition – Pushing “common sense” or norms to pressure alignment.
- **Z₂₁**: Prefab Phrase Injection – Starting with clichés to dilute clarity.
- **Z₂₂**: Buzzword Saturation – Drowning logic in trendy or borrowed terms.
- **Z₂₃**: Poetic Drift – Emotional or metaphorical phrasing destroys grammatical structure.
